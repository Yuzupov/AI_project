# AI_project

For this AI project there is some setup needed. It might take quite some time if you need to train it on your own model. Expect about 1.5 - 2 hours for the training with the dataset used.

## Setup
Run the setup.py file, htmx module 28.* is in the current state unusable due to removing a still used method. Therefore you need to downgrade to htmx v. 0.27.2 with "pip install htmx==0.27.2 for the prompts to execute correctly. After installing the potential dependencies, run the setup.py file.

## Using the bot
Run the chatbot.py file to start the bot. Input your prompt to the bot and wait for it to return the response in the terminal window
