Testing the AI:
Quiz 1:
Q1: 
	What is the product backlog?
Correct answer:
	A prioritized list of the things the customer wants.
ScrumAI Answer:
	The product backlog is a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done on a project. It is maintained by the product owner and serves as the single source of truth for what the development team should be focusing on. The product backlog is dynamic and constantly evolving as new requirements, features, and changes are added.

Points: 1/1

Q2:
	Which two fields in a user story (also known as a backlog item) are the most important, and why?
Correct answer:
	How to demo - a high-level description of how this story will be demonstrated. This is important, because it helps determine the scope of the story: what is included in the story, and what is not. (this field is to determine the scope of the story, which includes what tasks are for this story and what tasks are left for other stories).
	Name - a short, descriptive name. This is important, because it summarizes the story in a way that is easy to remember. (this field is to summarize the story and is usually the first or only thing the team looks at when discussing tasks related to the story.)
ScrumAI Answer:
	The two most important fields in a user story are the **Title/Summary** and the **Acceptance Criteria**.

	1. **Title/Summary**: A concise and descriptive title is crucial as it provides a quick overview of what the user story is about. It helps team members and stakeholders quickly grasp the essence of the story. A well-crafted title sets the context and guides further discussions and actions.

	2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete and working as expected. They provide clarity on the expected outcome and help prevent misunderstandings. Acceptance criteria serve as a reference point for the team during implementation and testing.

Points: 1/2.

Q3:
	Which two of the following backlog problems must be fixed before sprint planning?
Correct answer:
	There is not backlog yet
	A couple of stories were added when the product-owner was absent, and the product-owner hasn't yet looked at these stories.
ScrumAI Answer:
	1. Backlog items not clearly defined or lacking acceptance criteria.
	2. High-priority items not at the top of the backlog.

	These are examples of backlog refinement issues that need to be resolved before sprint planning to ensure that the team has a clear understanding of the work to be done in the upcoming sprint.
Points: 1/1

Explanation: 
	While the answers provided by the ScrumAI do not perfectly match what the MCQ (multiple choice question) alternatives are, it stresses the importance of a backlog (which is one of the mcq answers) hence we deem it acceptible. The other MCQ answer is context dependent and we did not feed the answer alternatives to the ScrumAI. However, the product owner is the person who is responsible for the priority of the stories. Therefore, we find that the second answer in the MCQ aligns with the ScrumAI answer of high priority items not at the top of the backlog, as the backlog itself now consists of stories without priorities.


Q4:
	Two kinds of meetings are the most important ones in Scrum. Sprint planning is one of them - which kind of meeting is the other one? 
Correct answer:
	Sprint retrospective
ScrumAI answer:
  	Sprint Demo (also known as "Sprint Review").

Points: 0/1.

Explanation: While the review is very important, the quiz lists "sprint retrospective" as the most important one as it gives the team the best chance to improve.
	
Q5:
	Must the product owner attend the sprint-planning meeting? 
Correct answer:
	It is very important that the product-owner attends the meeting. If the product owner cannot make it, a proxy has to attend instead.
ScrumAI answer:
	The product owner should definitely attend the sprint planning meeting. Their presence is crucial to provide direction and guidance to the development team. The product owner is responsible for setting priorities, defining requirements, and ensuring that the product backlog is up to date. Their input during the sprint planning meeting is essential for the team to plan and execute tasks effectively.

Points: 1/1

Explanation: 
	While not explicitly stating the exact same answer, the ScrumAI does point out the importance of the product owner attending the meeting and why it is important.

Q6:
	Must the whole team attend the sprint-planning meeting? 
Correct answer: 
	It is very important that the whole team attends the meeting. If some team-members cannot make it, the meeting (and the sprint) will suffer.
ScrumAI answer:
	###As an expert Scrum Master, I would recommend that the whole Scrum team attend the sprint planning meeting. This includes the product owner, the Scrum Master, and all members of the development team. The purpose of the sprint planning meeting is to bring together the entire team to discuss and commit to the goals, scope, and plan for the upcoming sprint. It is important for everyone to be present to ensure a shared understanding of the work to be done and to facilitate collaboration and communication. If a team member is unable to attend, it is a good practice to reschedule the meeting to a time when everyone can participate.

Points: 1/1

Explanation:
	The AI correctly identifies the importance of the whole team attending the meeting.

Q7:
	Mark the three variables that are open to discussion during sprint planning:
	The team's working hours.
	Quality level of each story.
	Importance of each story.
	Scope of each story.
	Time estimate for each story.
Correct answer:
	Importance of each story.
	Scope of each story.
	Time estimate for each story.
ScrumAI answer:
	Quality level of each story.
	Importance of each story.
	Time estimate for each story.

Points: 0.666666667/1

Quiz 2:
Q1:
	Your team needs to make a time-estimate for a user-story called "Registration". Unfortunately, no-one is sure how to finish the story, and that makes it hard to agree on an estimate.

	There are several ways to manage this situation. Check all the good ways!
Correct answer:
	Planning poker
	Break story down into engineering tasks
	Ask the product-owner to clarify "how to demo" the story.


ScrumAI answer:
	Good ways to manage this situation include:

	- Playing planning poker
	- Breaking down the story into engineering tasks
	- Asking the product owner to clarify "how to demo" the story

	These actions can help the team gain a better understanding of the user story and reach a more accurate time estimate.
Points:
	1/1

Explanation:

Q2:
	Your team is playing planning poker, to estimate the story called "Registration". The first two rounds revealed different ways of interpreting the story, and helped clarifying what to do. However, at both the third and the fourth rounds, three team members showed a "13", two showed an "8", and two showed a "5". The team realizes that a fifth round would probably get the same result again. How can the team agree on an estimate?

	There are several ways to manage this situation. Check all the good ways!
Correct answer:
	Team averages the value of the cards, rounding upwards and puts "10" as the estimate.
	The Scrum Master looks at all the cards, thinks for a second and suggests an estimate. The team agrees.

ScrumAI answer:
	Here are the good ways to manage the situation: 
	1. The team averages the values of the cards, rounding upwards, and puts "10" as the estimate.
	2. The Scrum Master looks at all the cards, thinks for a second, and suggests an estimate. The team agrees.

	It's important for the team to reach an agreement in a timely manner and continue with the planning process.
Points:
	1/1

Explanation:

Q3:
	Your team is planning the story called "Registration". The story needs to be broken down, but the team is not sure whether to split the story into smaller stories, or into engineering-tasks. How can the team know which is most appropriate?

	There are several ways to manage this situation. Check all the good ways!
	  Save the breakdown until the team has started work on the story, and therefore knows more.
	  Play a round of planning poker about the story called "Registration".
	  Briefly explain each part to the product-owner. Those parts that the product-owner is interested in can be separate stories.
	  Sort the parts into those involving program code, and those who don't.
	  Discuss "how to demo" smaller parts of the story. If some smaller parts can be demonstrated, each of those parts can be a story.
Correct answer:
	Play a round of planning poker about the story called "Registration.
	Briefly explain each part to the product-owner. Those parts taht the product owner is interested in can be separate stories.
	Discuss "how to demo" smaller parts of the story. If some smaller parts can be demonstrated, each of those parts can be a story.
ScrumAI answer:
	As an expert scrum master, you can guide the team on how to approach the breakdown of the story "Registration" in the planning session. Here's how you could help the team in this situation:

	1. **Play a Round of Planning Poker**: You could suggest playing a round of planning poker specifically for the "Registration" story. This can help the team gauge the complexity of the story and decide whether it should be split into smaller stories or engineering tasks.

	2. **Briefly Explain Parts to the Product Owner**: You could have the team briefly explain the various components of the "Registration" story to the product owner. Based on the product owner's interest and priority, the team can identify specific parts that could be split into separate stories.

	3. **Discuss Demo Scenarios for Smaller Parts**: Encourage the team to discuss how they would demo or showcase smaller parts of the "Registration" story. If certain parts can stand alone and provide value in a demo, they could be considered as individual stories.

	By using these techniques, you can help the team make an informed decision about whether to split the "Registration" story into smaller stories or engineering tasks.

Points: 1/1

Explanation:


Q4:
	Your team is splitting the story called "Registration" into several smaller parts, each containing a manageable thing-to-do. These parts are listed below.

	Some of the parts can be stories, if the product-owner approves of course. Some other parts are clearly engineering-tasks.

	Check all those parts that clearly must be engineering-tasks!
	  Sanitize user input to avoid SQL injection.
	  Write test case for database update.
	  Design a graphical user-interface (GUI) for registration.
	  Write code to initialize database.
	  Check whether or not a username is already in the database.

	  The team cleans the team-room, and the team members discuss some cool technology and have coffee. After a while, the team moves on to cleaning up the backlog, updating estimates, reading up on a code-library for next sprint, etcetera.
	  Until the start of the next sprint, each team member decides individually what kind of work to do - for example, reading up on some technology the team will need during next sprint.

ScrumAI answer:
	The team should continue the discussion from the retrospective to address any issues and opportunities for improvement. They should update the sprint backlog, review and update estimates for upcoming work, and work on any action items identified during the retrospective. Scheduling a sprint planning meeting for the next sprint is also a good idea. The team should not go home or work on unrelated tasks without aligning on the next steps.

The ScrumAI performed better in the early quizzes than the later. However, we deem that the later quizzes has questions that are more open to interpretation which LLM struggles with. The LLM might also be trained on other data than what the quiz is based on, providing different answers than what the source of the quizzes states. It is however above 50 % so the language model is better than a coin-toss, especially as the wrong answers subtract from the correct answers.
